/*! \page DOCRepresentation Representation

In general, an image is a space-domain, a paving of a domain of the Euclidean space containing an information in each cell. This space-domain representation is usually the direct image obtained by a microscopy. However, there is different kinds of representations of the information. The Fourier transform allows the correspondence between the  space-domain and the frequency-domain.  The wavelet transform  allows the correspondence between the  space-domain and the scale-space-domain. The choice of the representation depends on the particular problem. For instance, the noise can be seen as fluctuation with a short length correlation. In the Fourier space, this noise corresponds to high frequency and it is removed easily with a low pass filter.

\section Fourier Fourier analysis 

\subsection PopulationLibrary A simple case study  : low-pass filter

This library includes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and some basics filter in the Fourier space. For instance, this code is a low(hight)-pass filter:   
\code
        Mat2UI8 img;//2d grey-level image object
        img.load(POP_PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR+std::string("/image/iex.png"));//replace this path by those on your computer
        Mat2ComplexF64 imgcomplex;
        Convertor::fromRealImaginary(img,imgcomplex);
        Mat2ComplexF64 fft = Representation::FFT(imgcomplex);
        Mat2ComplexF64 filterlowpass(fft.getDomain());
        Vec2I32 x(0,0);
        Draw::disk(filterlowpass,x,20,NumericLimits<ComplexF64>::maximumRange(),1);
        fft = Processing::mask(fft,filterlowpass);
        //Representation::FFTDisplay(fft).display();
        imgcomplex = Representation::FFT(fft,-1);
        Mat2F64 imgd;
        Convertor::toRealImaginary(imgcomplex,imgd);
        Mat2UI8 filter = Processing::greylevelRange(imgd,0,255);
        filter.save("/home/vincent/Population/doc/image/iexlowpass.jpg");
        double threshold_automatic;
        Mat2UI8 threshold = Processing::thresholdOtsuMethod(filter,threshold_automatic);
        Visualization::labelForegroundBoundary(threshold,img,2).save("/home/vincent/Population/doc/image/iexseglowpass.jpg");
\endcode

For a filter with a custom mask, you can create it with the gimp sofware:
- Open the image with this sofware,
- Open a new layer with the onglet layer->New Layer,
- Open the dialog for the selection of the layer with the onglet windows->Dockable dialogs->layer,  
- In this dialog select the layer new lawer,
- Create the mask with the utilisation of the pencil tool (select the black colour),
- Invert the mask Colours->Invert,
- Display only the new layer, in the dialog for the selection of the layer, remove the eye for the background layer,
- Save the image. 


\subsection Wave  Wave

A wave is a oscillation that propagates through space. The observation of the surface wave after a stone throw leads to  a first level for the wave description, \f$f\f$, as a cosine wave described by the equation:
\f[f(x,t) = A \cos (kx - wt + \phi )\,\f]
where A is the amplitude of the wave, x is the space coordinate, t is the time coordinate, k is the wavenumber (spatial frequency), w is the temporal frequency, and \f$\phi \f$ is the phase. Moreover, the observation of the surface wave after a multiple stone throws leads to  a second level for the wave description, \f$f\f$, as a sum of cosine waves described by the equation
\f[f(x,t) = \sum_i A_i \cos (k_ix - w_it + \phi_i ).\f]
Now, let us consider that, at the given locating (x is fixed), we receive the sound, given by the signal \f$f(x=cst,t)\f$ with period \f$T\f$.  The measure starts at time  \f$t_0=0\f$ when the signal is maximum. The previous equation can be written in a such fashion way :
\f[f(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty  A_n \cos ( 2\pi \frac{n}{T} t).\f]
The sound engineer aims the filtering of the sound. The first level is to recover the importance of the different frequency given by the amplitude \f$A_n\f$ starting from the original signal. The coefficient \f$A_n\f$ is given by this formula:
\f[A_n = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^{T} f(t)\cdot e^{-i 2\pi \frac{n}{T} t}\, dt.\f]
This last equation is the Fourier's formula for T-periodic functions using cosines.\n
In Fourier space, a high (or low) amplitude \f$A_n\f$, means the contribution of the frequency, \f$w= 2\pi \frac{n}{T}\f$ is important for the reconstruction of the function \f$f\f$. For instance, the song ''enter of sandman'' of metalica [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QP-SIW6iKY], seems dominated by low-pitched sounds whereas, the song of Kostas Kastanis for the movie Zorba the Greek [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UgndyMfe-8] seems dominated by high-pitched sounds. The spectrum frequency  should show high value of the amplitude of coefficients \f$A_n\f$ at low frequency and  low value of the amplitude of coefficients \f$A_n\f$ at high frequency for ''enter of sandman'' and inversely for Kostas Kastanis.\n 
For instance, in this signal, you have two frequencies, with an amplitude not equal to 0

such that the original signal is   \f$f(t) = cos(2\pi t)+0.5cos(2\pi \frac{3}{2} t)  \f$.

\subsection FourrierDiscrete Fourier transformation in discrete space

For an image, the Fourier analysis is exactly the same expect:
- the space replaces the time,
- the space is dicrete.

Let us consider a 2-D image of size N*N. The Fourier transformation of the function,''f'', noted, \f$\mathcal{F}[f]\f$  is, in this case:
\f[\mathcal{F}[f](u,v)=\frac{1}{N^2}\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{-2\pi  (xu+yv)/N}f(x,y)\f]
The inverse Fourier transformation of the function,''f'', noted, \f$\mathcal{F}^{-1}[f]\f$ is
\f[\mathcal{F}^{-1}[f](x,y)=\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{2\pi  (xu+yv)/N}f(u,v)\f]
Some important properties and remarks:
- the norm of the Fourier space,   \f$\|\mathcal{F}[f]]\|= \sqrt{\mathcal{F}[f]\cdot\mathcal{F}[f]^* } \f$ is symmetric where the symbol \f$^*\f$ is the conjugate. 
- due to the large variations of the function \f$\|\mathcal{F}[f]]\|\f$, the plot is done in log-scale \f$\log(\|\mathcal{F}[f]]\|+1)  \f$,
- the frequency increases when the distance to the point and the center of image increases, and the direction between the point and the center gives the direction of oscillations. 
- large values at high frequency components mean that the image is changing rapidly on a short length scale and inversely. 
- the operator  \f$\mathcal{F}^{-1}\circ\mathcal{F}\f$ is the identity operator:  \f$\mathcal{F}^{-1}\circ\mathcal{F}[f]=f\f$.
For the better understanding, we will filter the Fourier representation of Gaston with a mask then, we will reconstruct the image using the inverse Fourier transformation.<br>
In this first raw, the reconstruct image has only the small frequencies since the mask is a low pass filtering. We observe that the tint is conserved (low frequencies) but many details are lose as the eyes, and the boundaries are blurred (high frequencies).

\subsection filtering  Filtering
The noise is often a fluctuation with a correlation at short length. In the Fourier space, this noise corresponds to high frequency and it is removed easily with a low pass.

\subsection Extraction Pattern extraction
A image, f, can be the addition of different patterns, \f$g_i\f$:
\f[f=\sum_i g_i.\f]
If the patterns are periodics, the filtering in the Fourier space allows to recover their indvidually.
In the image below, we observe a surface of clean Gold (Au(100)) imaging with Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Atomic_resolution_Au100.JPG wikipedia]:
