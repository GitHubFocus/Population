        \author Tariel Vincent

      * The class DistributionMultiVariate, not named function to avoid any confusions with the function concept,  is a mapping from the multi variate numbers
      * to the real number where the input element, x=(x_0,x_1,..x_n), completely determines the output element, y,  by this relation: y = f(x_0,x_1,..x_n).
      * For this class, the evaluation of the output element from an input element is a symbolic (implicit) relation for instance,
      * for a function equal to \f$x=(x_0,x_1) \mapsto x_1\exp(-x_0^2)\f$, the output element is evaluated by the multiplication of the input element by itself.\n
      *
      * \note I am still not satisfy with this class, and some major modifications can occur in the next release
